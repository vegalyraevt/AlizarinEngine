> The ALIZARIN Engine is currently in **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Generation**. This project is being developed live on stream as a public-facing R&D process.

***

## ⚙️ Core Engine Overview

The engine's first voice, the mascott voice and proof-of-concept, is developed under the name **ALIZARIN** sharing a name with the engine.

The ALIZARIN Engine is a high-level, LGPLv3-licensed voice synthesis framework designed for generating multiple voice products (real-time TTS, AI singing, and concatenative singing) from a single, **100% synthetic source**. This initiative is inspired by the pioneering work of missile_39's Adachi Rei, but takes a **different approach** to the "no-human-inside" concept by utilizing a unique hybrid method that incorporates both **modern latent-space AI** and **algorithmic formant synthesis** reminiscent of classic systems based on the style of the Votrax SC-01 and its Tandy TRS-80 Voice Synthesizer.

### ALIZARIN: The Engine's Acronym

The name is an acronym for the core components of its design:

* **A**ugmented (The layered texture system)
* **L**atent (The core AI representation)
* **I**ntonation (The quality speech output)
* Synthesi**z**er (The engine's primary function)
* **A**lgorithm (The base Pyo formant system)
* **R**ecursive (The neural network's processing method)
* **I**nference (The process of generating audio)
* **N**etwork (The foundational neural architecture)

***

## 🛡️ Philosophy & Ethical Commitment

The ALIZARIN Engine is an open-source, community-focused project with a specific set of goals:

1.  **Unique, Non-Human Voices:** The engine's core philosophy is "no human inside." It is designed to create voices from the ground up using algorithmic and synthetic sources, allowing for truly unique, non-human character identities like missile_39's Adachi Rei voice. I aim not to replace or copy their work, but to pay tribute to their work by adding new voice models and styles to the archetype missile_39's models fill with unique sounding models.
2.  **Ethical Commercial Voices:** This framework provides a high-quality, free, and open-source path for commercial voices without needing to record, clone, or "steal" an existing human voice.
3.  **Protect Voice Actors:** The synthetic nature of the voice makes it identifiable as non-human, reducing the chances of being used in fraud or to replace an existing voice actor. This promotes ethical behavior by offering a creative alternative to unauthorized voice clones that I hope many will adopt as an ethical alternative.

> **Goal:** To create an "all-encompassing" voice solution, pairing modern TTS with expressive singers (DiffSinger, UTAU) to allow creators to build complete character identities with consistent voices across delivery methods.

***

## ⚖️ Licensing Model (The ALIZARIN Framework)

This project is built on an ideology of community contribution and creator freedom. We use the **LGPLv3 License** to achieve a "best-of-both-worlds" scenario:

* **A Free, Shared Community Resource:** The ALIZARIN Engine framework is (and always will be) open-source. Any modifications or improvements made *to the engine framework itself* must be shared back with the community.
* **Allowance for Unique, Private Voices:** The LGPLv3 license draws a "bright line" between **"The Library"** (our engine) and **"A Work that Uses The Library"** (your voice). Your "secret sauce" (formant scripts, texture kits, training data) remains **100% your own property** and does not need to be shared, allowing for unique privately licensed voices made from a free and growing community ecosystem.

### Community & Ethical Use Requests (Non-Binding)

The following points are **not** requirements or conditions of the LGPLv3 license, nor are they possible restrictions to place under the required license to make this sharable. These are our sincere requests to you, the user, to foster a positive and ethical community environment.

* 💖 **A Request from the Creator (Sharing):** We would love for you to share your public creations with the community and the ALIZARIN Engine team. If your voice is posted publicly, please consider sending us a link and use #ALIZARIN on your social media posts to tag us! 🎶
* 🛑 **A Request from the Creator (Ethical Usage):** We ask all creators using this framework to voluntarily adopt the following minimal restrictions for any voice derived from the ALIZARIN Engine:
    * **No Hateful Content:** Do not use the voice to create or distribute hate speech, harassment, severe threats, or content promoting violence or illegal acts.
    * **No Impersonation or Fraud:** Do not use the voice to impersonate identifiable individuals, especially for the purpose of financial fraud, manipulation, or unauthorized commercial exploitation.
    * **Transparent Disclosure:** Disclose clearly that the voice used in any public-facing content is synthetic and was created by a computational process.

## 🚀 Community Initiative Goals

### I. 💰 Funding Goals (Tiered Deliverables)

The following goals represent tangible product releases and services that will be delivered upon successful funding.

| Goal | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Upgrade 1: Finetune Duo Voice Pack** | **HARD GOAL (Singing/Data):** Fund the complete process of generating, training, and releasing the **two pre-trained DiffSinger Community Base Models** and their raw, untextured synthetic training data. This includes all required server time and R&D hours to train two models from scratch. |
| **Upgrade 2: Finetune Duo TTS Pack** | **HARD GOAL (Speaking/TTS):** Fund the process of generating **TTS-specific datasets** and **fine-tuning** the base MeloTTS model with the new speakers. This results in the release of the two pre-trained **MeloTTS Community Base Models**, making custom TTS creation easier for users. |
| **Upgrade 3: Public RVC Sandbox** | Release a specialized Python/Colab notebook for easy, localized, fine-tuning of the base models into a real-time RVC voice changer. |

---

### II. 🗣️ Conditional Goals (Community Collaboration)

These features rely on collaboration and linguistic expertise from the community, as the creator only speaks English.

| Goal | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multilingual Phonemizer Integration** | Integrate, test, and validate code to support additional languages (e.g., Japanese/Spanish) in the ALIZARIN Engine. **Requires collaboration with native speakers** for linguistic validation and accent refinement. |
| **Advanced Accent/Pronunciation Support** | Research and develop methods to incorporate slight characterization or accent without losing the non-human synthetic core. |
| **Non-English Language Pack Integration** | Integrate and validate open-source phonemizer tools for non-English languages (requires external linguistic testing and time). |

---

### III. ✨ Stretch Goals (Long-Term Research)

These are complex, long-term experimental projects that will be prioritized *after* the main ALIZARIN voice is successfully delivered and its core technology is stable.

| Goal | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Consenting Voice Actor Module** | Develop the workflow and legal framework for co-owning hybrid voices made by mixing synthetic audio with small human voice samples. The goal is to provide slight characterization and clarity in pronunciation or accent as an alternative option while strictly maintaining the non-human sound and personality of the final voice. |
| **Hybrid Data Training & Automation Tool** | Research and develop a **tool** to automate the mixing of the current synthetic output (Formant + Textures) with additional, specialized synthetic elements (like Adachi Rei's pure sine/buzz sounds). The goal is to create novel training sets that improve tone and quality by precisely blending these core synthetic sources. |
| **Initial Paper & Methodology Release** | Publish a detailed paper/blog post explaining the full technical and ethical methodology of the ALIZARIN Engine. This serves as an official output goal to establish academic recognition and attract contributors. |
